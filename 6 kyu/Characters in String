Description:
The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.
///

def count(s): #s is a string
    dic = {}
    for x in s: #go through the string
        if x not in dic: #add keys to dictionary
            dic[x] = s.count(x) #value is the count
    return dic
