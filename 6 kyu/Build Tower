Description:

Build a pyramid-shaped tower, as an array/list of strings, given a positive integer number of floors. A tower block is represented with "*" character.

For example, a tower with 3 floors looks like this:

[
  "  *  ",
  " *** ", 
  "*****"
]
And a tower with 6 floors looks like this:

[
  "     *     ", 
  "    ***    ", 
  "   *****   ", 
  "  *******  ", 
  " ********* ", 
  "***********"
]
///

def tower_builder(n_floors):
    
    current_floor = 0
    add = 1 # this tracks the number of * that should be on each floor
    line = (n_floors * 2) - 1 # this is used to calcualate the padding needed for each floor
    tower = [] # list containing the pyramid-shaped tower
    
    while current_floor < n_floors: 
        tower.append(f"{'*' * add:^{line}}") # this centers the *'s' and adds padding 
        add += 2 # updates add to have the correct number of *'s' for the next floor
        current_floor += 1 # moves to next floor
        
    return tower
